            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I still remember vividly how my mom and I 
                    spent many evenings making Japanese Hamburger Steak. 
                    If I was home, she would call me around 4:30 PM 
                    and always encouraged my presence in the kitchen. 
                    Unless I was in the middle of a novel that 
                    I couldn't stop reading, I didn't mind helping 
                    her out most of the time. That's how I learned 
                    to cook Japanese food from her.</p>
                <p>Japanese Hamburger Steak is a popular dish enjoyed 
                    both at home and at Yoshoku (Japanese style western food)
                    restaurants. It's a steak made from ground meat 
                    and usually served with rice rather than buns.</p>
