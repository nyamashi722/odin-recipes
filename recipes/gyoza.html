            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Gyoza or Japanese pan-fried dumplings, are as 
                ubiquitous as ramen in Japan. You can find these 
                mouthwatering dumplings being served at specialty shops, 
                izakaya, ramen shops, grocery stores or even at festivals.</p>
            <p>The original Chinese dumplings are called Jiaozi. 
                These dumplings consist of ground meat and vegetable 
                filling that are wrapped into a thinly rolled piece of dough, 
                which is then sealed by pressing the edges together. 
                Finished jiaozi can be boiled, steamed, pan-fried, or deep-fried.</p>

                    <li>Discard the thick core of the cabbage leaves;

                    <li>Mince the green onions and shiitake mushrooms

                    <li>Mix well and knead the mixture with your hand until

                    <li>Fill wrapper with mixture and fold gyoza into shape</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>To cook the gyoza</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. 
                        When the pan is hot, place the gyoza in a single layer, 
                        flat side down in a circular pattern</li>
                    <li>Cook until the bottom of the gyoza turns golden brown, 
                        about 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add 1/4 cup of water to the pan. Immediately cover with a 
                        lid and steam the gyoza for about 3 minutes or until most 
                        of the water evaporates.</li>
                    <li>Remove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. 
                        Drizzle 1 tsp sesame oil around the gyoza in the frying pan.</li>
                    <li>Cook uncovered until the gyoza is golden 
                        brown and crisp on the bottom. </li>
                    <li>Transfer to a plate and serve with the dipping sauce. 
                        For the dipping sauce, combine the sauce ingredients 
                        in a small plate and mix together. </li>
